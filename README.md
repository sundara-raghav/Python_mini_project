**ABSTRACT**

This project visualizes population data for South Indian states from 2010 to 2025 using multiple types of plots. 
The data is sourced from a CSV file containing annual population figures for Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana. 
The visualizations include a bar chart showing the population of these states in 2020, a histogram displaying the distribution of populations in 2020,
a line graph illustrating population trends over the years, and a pie chart representing the population distribution among the states in 2020. 
These visualizations offer insights into regional population dynamics and trends, aiding in comparative and trend analysis.
